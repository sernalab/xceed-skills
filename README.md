# FRONTEND - THE LIGA CHALLENGE

Hi there! In order to test your ninja skills, we’ve put together a simple task for you to be done in the next 48h (although it won’t take you more than 2 to 3 hours, depending on how many coffees you’ll need in between).
It goes without saying, that the code must be well structured and commented, that design must be responsive, fast-loading and easy to maintain.
Feel free to be creative in the graphic design (parallax effects, hover actions, loading spinners, transitions, etc). And choose the option you prefer for consuming API info, as well as any js framework if you want to use any.

## SPECS:

You’re going to realize a list of football players of the first division of the Spanish Football League.

You’re going to retrieve all the info you need via API RESTful at:
http://api.football-data.org/v1/soccerseasons/399/teams
(set the X-Auth-Token header to: f7f2051260a8417b8eae9fb4de617af3)

The goal is to display a list of all football players according to the design provided.

This list should be dynamic, meaning that it will have filtering and sorting controls.

For every Player, you’re going to show:
• Player’s Club
• Player’s Club symbol
• Player’s Name
• Player’s Role
• Player’s Nationality

Each column should have filtering and sorting controls, except for Name, which will have only sorting and for Symbol, which will have no controls. Filters will be a list of all possible values, with a checkbox to enable/disable it. Players count has to be updated after each filtering action.

Optional: Sticky header. Make the table header sticky on scrolling down in the list.

Power up: Search option. Develop a searcher for the player’s name field.
